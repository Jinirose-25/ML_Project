*****Healthcare Analytics Project: Predicting Diabetes Onset with Machine Learning****
This is a ML project done on Diabetes using different algorithms
 It involved using the diabetes dataset to develop models for predicting diabetes onset. I applied various algorithms including SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, and K-Means clustering. The SVM Classifier achieved 74% accuracy, demonstrating strong performance in distinguishing between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, while KNN closely followed with 73% accuracy, This project showcased my expertise in data analysis, model evaluation, and visualization techniques to derive actionable insights for improving healthcare outcomes and patient management strategies.
